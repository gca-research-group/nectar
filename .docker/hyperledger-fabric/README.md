# Supply Chain

## Scenario

A company wants to track the movement of products in its supply chain, ensuring transparency and authenticity. The blockchain will store details like the product's origin, current location, and ownership history. Participants include:

Manufacturer – Produces the product and adds it to the blockchain.
Distributor – Ships the product and updates its status.
Retailer – Receives the product and finalises the transaction.


## Step 1
Firstly, it is necessary to generate the crypto material that will be used to authenticate the network transactions. In a production environment, this is done by independent Certificate Authorities; however, in development environments, we use the cryptogen tool.
